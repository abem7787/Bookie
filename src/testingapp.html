            In any business situation, it is imperative to present your ideas in a clear and concise way, and many times this will involve presenting numerical data in a visual format. To do this, many business people use tables. In this unit, you’ll learn how to capture information in a table, change its size and structure, add and format its text, and sort your information to glean valuable insights.
      
      Now, imagine that you have risen through the ranks to the role of <b>business</b> analyst for a company that publishes daily horoscopes: this means that you are in charge of analyzing data about the company’s performance and presenting important information to decision makers so that they can decide on the business strategies they want to implement. An important role to be sure. Your experience so far in content management has paved the way for this transition, and in this new position you will likely be utilizing some new tools: namely tables.

                A <b>table</b> is an arrangement of information in rows and columns containing cells that make comparing and contrasting information easier. Just as written content can communicate to prospective customers the benefits and features of a product, content presented in tables helps people more quickly digest complex information so that they can make decisions.
